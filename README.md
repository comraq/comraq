A repo containing some of the useful tools, methods and helpful functions
which I made for myself as practice/understanding but also to use across
projects         

Custom project/app directories are defined in gulp/paths.js      

Commands:     
npm install - installs all dependencies listed in package.json      

npm run build - transpiles/builds all necessary files for production, without sourcemaps     
npm run buildd - transpiles/builds all necessary files, with sourcemaps     

npm run watchd - transpiles/builds all with sourcemaps, then watches for
src js changes and auto rebuild           

npm test - watches for src js changes, then run tests
